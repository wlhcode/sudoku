Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. (Source: Wikipedia)
 
In this version of Sudoku, you must enter the row number and column letter and input the number to be filled in. It is guaranteed that there is only one unique solution. You may give up by typing `/` in the field `Enter Column Number`. Stages are completely randomized upon entry.

## Fun Fact
This project was inspired by a problem in a proramming competition. Originally, this is merely a solution to the said problem, but later turned into a game.
