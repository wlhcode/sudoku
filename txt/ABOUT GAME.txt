  Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. 
  The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column,
  each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid
  contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. (Source: Wikipedia)
  
  In this version of Sudoku, a 9x9 grid with 25 numbers already in it
  will be provided. You are to enter the row number and column letter
  and input the number to be filled in. It is guaranteed that there is
  only one unique solution. You may give up by typing '/' in the field
  'Enter Column Letters'.
  
  Please be reminded that stages are completely randomized upon entry.
